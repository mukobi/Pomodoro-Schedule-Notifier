VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

I am the author of this sofware. 
To verify the checksum of this software:
1. zip the contents of the installed C:/tools/Pomodoro-Schedule-Notifier folder
Note: zip the contents of that folder, NOT the folder itself. This is the same zip you can download from
https://github.com/mukobi/Pomodoro-Schedule-Notifier/releases/

2. Run a sha256 hash of the zipped file. In Powershell, you can use this command (make sure the zip path is correct):
```
Get-FileHash "C:\oath\to\zipped_file.zip" -Algorithm SHA256
```

3. Ensure the SHA256 hash of the zipped folder contents match this:
DB1FDB5EB066299AB081AA7E84F3A30E1864B0339350246660488F1C6D48795D

4. Optionally, you can also hash just the main PomodoroScheduleNotifier.exe file and check this hash:
```
Get-FileHash "C:\tools\Pomodoro-Schedule-Notifier\PomodoroScheduleNotifier.exe" -Algorithm SHA256
```
